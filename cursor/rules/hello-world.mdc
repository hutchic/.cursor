# Hello World Rule

This rule establishes standards and guidelines for hello world artifacts. It demonstrates how **rules provide persistent guidance** that skills and commands can reference and follow.

## When to Use

- When creating or using hello world artifacts
- When testing the relationship between rules, skills, and commands
- As an example of how rules establish standards that other artifacts follow

## Guidelines

### Hello World Standards

When working with hello world artifacts, follow these standards established by this rule:

1. **Consistency**: All hello world artifacts should use consistent naming and structure
2. **Simplicity**: Hello world examples should be minimal but demonstrate key concepts
3. **Cross-Reference**: Hello world artifacts should reference each other to show relationships
4. **Purpose**: Each hello world artifact should clearly demonstrate its artifact type

### How Rules Work with Skills and Commands

- **Rules provide standards**: This rule establishes what "hello world" means and how it should be used
- **Skills implement standards**: The [hello-world skill](.cursor/skills/hello-world/SKILL.md) provides instructions that follow these standards
- **Commands use both**: The [hello-world command](.cursor/commands/hello-world.md) creates a workflow that uses both the rule's standards and the skill's instructions

## Example: Rule → Skill → Command Flow

1. **Rule (this file)**: Establishes that hello world artifacts should be simple, consistent, and cross-referenced
2. **Skill**: Provides step-by-step instructions for creating hello world artifacts, following the rule's standards
3. **Command**: Creates a workflow that uses the skill's instructions to verify the rule's standards are met

## Related Artifacts

- [Hello World Skill](.cursor/skills/hello-world/SKILL.md) - Implements the instructions that follow this rule's standards
- [Hello World Command](.cursor/commands/hello-world.md) - Creates a workflow using both this rule and the skill
- [Hello World Subagent](.cursor/agents/hello-world.md) - Demonstrates subagent structure
- [Rule Template](cursor/templates/rule-template.md)
- [Cursor Rules Documentation](docs/cursor-rules.md)

## How This Demonstrates Rule → Skill → Command Relationship

This rule, along with the hello-world skill and command, demonstrates:

- **Rules set standards**: This rule defines what hello world means and how it should work
- **Skills provide implementation**: The skill gives actionable steps that follow the rule
- **Commands create workflows**: The command orchestrates using both rule and skill together

## Notes

This is a test/example rule. It can be safely removed or modified for testing purposes.
