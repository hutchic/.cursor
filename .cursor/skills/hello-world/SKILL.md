# Hello World Skill

This skill provides **actionable instructions** for working with hello world artifacts. It demonstrates how **skills implement the standards from rules** and provide the **detailed steps that commands use**.

## When to Use

- When you need step-by-step instructions for hello world artifacts
- When testing how skills implement rule standards
- When creating workflows that use both rules and skills
- As an example of how skills bridge rules and commands

## Instructions

### Following Rule Standards

The [hello-world rule](.cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc) establishes standards for hello world artifacts. This skill provides instructions that follow those standards:

1. **Consistency**: Use consistent naming (`hello-world` for all artifacts)
2. **Simplicity**: Keep examples minimal but demonstrate key concepts
3. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related hello world artifacts
4. **Purpose**: Clearly show what each artifact type does

### Step-by-Step Instructions

When working with hello world artifacts:

1. **Review the rule**: Check the [hello-world rule](.cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc) to understand the standards
2. **Follow the standards**: Apply the rule's guidelines when creating or using artifacts
3. **Use this skill**: Follow these instructions to implement the rule's standards
4. **Execute the command**: Use the [hello-world command](.cursor/commands/hello-world.md) to create a complete workflow

### How Skills Work with Rules and Commands

- **Rules provide standards**: The rule says "hello world should be simple and consistent"
- **Skills provide implementation**: This skill says "here's how to make it simple and consistent"
- **Commands create workflows**: The command says "use the skill's instructions to verify the rule's standards"

## Examples

### Example 1: Rule → Skill Flow

1. **Rule establishes**: "Hello world artifacts should be simple"
2. **Skill implements**: "To make it simple, follow these 4 steps..."
3. **Result**: You have actionable instructions that follow the standard

### Example 2: Skill → Command Flow

1. **Skill provides**: Step-by-step instructions for creating hello world artifacts
2. **Command uses**: Those instructions in a structured workflow
3. **Result**: A complete process that implements the skill's guidance

## Related Artifacts

- [Hello World Rule](.cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc) - Establishes standards that this skill implements
- [Hello World Command](.cursor/commands/hello-world.md) - Uses this skill's instructions in a workflow
- [Hello World Subagent](.cursor/agents/hello-world.md) - Demonstrates subagent structure
- [Skill Template](cursor/templates/skill-template.md)
- [Cursor Skills Documentation](docs/cursor-skills.md)

## How This Demonstrates Skill's Role

This skill demonstrates how skills work between rules and commands:

- **Implements rules**: Takes the rule's standards and provides actionable steps
- **Enables commands**: Provides the detailed instructions that commands use
- **Bridges concepts**: Connects abstract standards (rules) with concrete workflows (commands)
