# Hello World Command

## Overview

This command creates a **complete workflow** that uses both the [hello-world rule](.cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc) (standards) and the [hello-world skill](.cursor/skills/hello-world/SKILL.md) (instructions). It demonstrates how **commands orchestrate rules and skills** into actionable workflows.

## When to Use

- When you want to see how rules, skills, and commands work together
- When testing the complete rule → skill → command flow
- When creating a workflow that uses both standards and instructions
- As an example of how commands bring rules and skills together

## Steps

This workflow demonstrates the rule → skill → command relationship:

1. **Reference the rule**: Review the [hello-world rule](.cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc) to understand the standards
   - The rule establishes: "Hello world should be simple, consistent, and cross-referenced"

2. **Use the skill**: Apply the [hello-world skill](.cursor/skills/hello-world/SKILL.md) instructions
   - The skill provides: Step-by-step instructions for following the rule's standards

3. **Execute the workflow**: Follow this command's steps to complete the process
   - The command creates: A structured workflow using both rule and skill

4. **Verify integration**: Confirm that:
   - The rule's standards are followed
   - The skill's instructions are applied
   - The command's workflow is complete

## Checklist

- [ ] Reviewed the [hello-world rule](.cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc) standards
- [ ] Applied the [hello-world skill](.cursor/skills/hello-world/SKILL.md) instructions
- [ ] Completed this command's workflow
- [ ] Verified all three artifacts work together
- [ ] Understood how rules, skills, and commands complement each other

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete Rule → Skill → Command Flow

**Scenario**: You want to create a hello world artifact

1. **Rule provides standards**: The [hello-world rule](.cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc) says "keep it simple and consistent"
2. **Skill provides steps**: The [hello-world skill](.cursor/skills/hello-world/SKILL.md) says "here's how: step 1, step 2, step 3..."
3. **Command creates workflow**: This command says "use the rule's standards and skill's steps in this order"
4. **Result**: A complete, structured process that uses all three artifact types

### Example 2: How They Complement Each Other

- **Rule (persistent)**: Always available, sets the "what" and "why"
- **Skill (actionable)**: Provides the "how" with detailed instructions
- **Command (workflow)**: Orchestrates the "when" and "in what order"

## Related Artifacts

- [Hello World Rule](.cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc) - Provides the standards this command workflow follows
- [Hello World Skill](.cursor/skills/hello-world/SKILL.md) - Provides the instructions this command workflow uses
- [Hello World Subagent](.cursor/agents/hello-world.md) - Demonstrates subagent structure
- [Command Template](.cursor/templates/command-template.md)
- [Cursor Commands Documentation](docs/cursor-commands.md)

## How This Demonstrates Command's Role

This command demonstrates how commands orchestrate rules and skills:

- **Uses rules**: References the rule's standards as the foundation
- **Uses skills**: Applies the skill's instructions as the implementation
- **Creates workflow**: Combines both into a structured, actionable process
- **Shows integration**: Demonstrates how all three artifact types work together
