# Artifact Creation Rules

Decision framework for creating rules, skills, commands, and subagents.

## When to Create an Artifact

### Create an Artifact When

- Pattern appears multiple times in conversations
- Instruction is repeated or corrected
- Workflow is used frequently
- Domain knowledge should persist
- Process should be standardized
- Team needs shared guidance

### Don't Create an Artifact When

- One-time instruction or task
- Knowledge already clear from code
- Pattern is too vague or abstract
- Linter/formatter would be more appropriate
- Common tool documentation (AI already knows)

## Decision Framework: Rule vs Skill vs Command vs Subagent

### Create a Rule When

- **Persistent guidance** needed across sessions
- **Domain-specific knowledge** that should always be available
- **Style and architecture standards** for the project
- **Context-aware patterns** based on file types
- **Team collaboration** needs shared conventions

**Characteristics:**
- Included in context automatically (based on configuration)
- Provides persistent guidance
- Can be file-specific via globs
- No executable scripts

### Create a Skill When

- **Domain knowledge** with executable scripts
- **Workflows** that include automation
- **Complex procedures** needing structured guidance
- **Knowledge** that should be available across projects
- **Tasks** that benefit from automatic detection

**Characteristics:**
- Can include executable scripts
- Automatically detected by agent
- Progressive loading (references/assets)
- Portable across projects
- Decomposable: usable on their own or in any automation; describe "When to Use" by capability, not by a specific command

### Create a Command When

- **Manual workflows** and checklists
- **Step-by-step processes** that need structured guidance
- **Tasks** that should be triggered manually
- **Team standardization** of workflows
- **Quick, repeatable actions**

**Characteristics:**
- Invoked manually with `/command-name`
- No automatic context inclusion
- Simple markdown structure
- No executable scripts

### Create a Subagent When

- **Complex tasks** needing context isolation
- **Long-running research** or exploration
- **Parallel workstreams** for different tasks
- **Independent verification** of work
- **Specialized expertise** across many steps

**Characteristics:**
- Own context window (isolated)
- Can run in parallel
- Specialized prompts and configuration
- Can use different models

## Artifact Selection Decision Tree

```
Is the task simple and single-purpose?
├─ Yes → Is it a checklist/workflow?
│   ├─ Yes → Command
│   └─ No → Does it need scripts?
│       ├─ Yes → Skill
│       └─ No → Rule
└─ No → Does it need context isolation?
    ├─ Yes → Subagent
    └─ No → Does it need scripts?
        ├─ Yes → Skill
        └─ No → Rule
```

## Naming and Organization Standards

### Naming

- Use kebab-case consistently
- Be descriptive but concise
- Follow naming patterns for each type
- Avoid abbreviations

### Organization

- Place in appropriate category
- Use meta/ for system management artifacts
- Group related artifacts together
- Follow directory structure standards

## Avoiding Duplication

### Before Creating

1. **Search existing artifacts**: Check if similar artifact exists
2. **Review related artifacts**: Check related categories
3. **Consider consolidation**: Can existing artifact be extended?
4. **Check documentation**: Review docs for similar patterns

### When Duplicates Exist

1. **Compare artifacts**: Identify differences
2. **Consolidate if possible**: Merge into single artifact
3. **Differentiate clearly**: If keeping separate, make differences clear
4. **Update references**: Update all cross-references

## Using Creator Skills When Implementing Plans

When drafting or implementing a plan that creates new skills or commands:

- **For each new skill**: Use the [Skill-creator skill](.cursor/skills/meta/skill-creator/SKILL.md) (frontmatter, concise body, progressive disclosure, Cursor paths).
- **For each new command**: Use the [Command-creator skill](.cursor/skills/meta/command-creator/SKILL.md) with **Cursor paths** (`.cursor/commands/`, not `.claude/commands/`) and Cursor command shape (e.g. [process-chat](.cursor/commands/meta/process-chat.md), [create-artifact](.cursor/commands/meta/create-artifact.md)).

Plans that add skills or commands should explicitly require these creator skills so implementers follow the same workflow. See [Shipit Automation Plan](docs/plans/shipit-automation.md) for an example.

## Artifact Creation Process

1. **Identify pattern**: Extract pattern from conversation/analysis
2. **Select type**: Choose rule/skill/command/subagent
3. **Choose template**: Use appropriate template
4. **Create artifact**: Write content following standards
5. **Organize**: Place in appropriate category
6. **Cross-reference**: Add references to related artifacts
7. **Document**: Update documentation
8. **Validate**: Verify artifact works correctly

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Create minimal artifact first, refine later
2. **Use templates**: Always use templates for consistency
3. **Follow standards**: Adhere to naming and organization standards
4. **Add references**: Include cross-references from the start
5. **Update docs**: Keep documentation in sync
6. **Test artifacts**: Verify artifacts work as expected
