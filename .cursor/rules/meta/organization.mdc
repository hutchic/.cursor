# Organization Rules

Rules for maintaining clean, organized structure in this meta-repository.

## Categorization Standards

### When to Create Categories

- **3+ related artifacts**: Create a category when you have 3 or more related items
- **Clear domain boundary**: When artifacts belong to distinct domains
- **Growth potential**: When category is likely to grow beyond a few items

### Category Structure

```
cursor/
├── rules/
│   ├── meta/              # Meta rules for system management
│   └── organization/       # Organization-specific rules
├── skills/
│   ├── meta/              # Meta skills for system management
│   └── analysis/          # Analysis and pattern extraction
├── commands/
│   └── meta/              # Meta commands for system management
└── agents/
    └── meta/              # Meta subagents for system management
```

### Category Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `code-review`, `deployment`
- Be descriptive: `frontend-components` not `frontend`
- Keep it short: `testing` not `testing-and-quality-assurance`
- Use plural for collections: `commands/` not `command/`

## Naming Conventions

### Rules

- Format: `kebab-case.mdc` or `kebab-case.md`
- Pattern: `domain-topic` or `topic-type`
- Examples: `frontend-components.mdc`, `api-standards.mdc`

### Skills

- Format: `kebab-case/` folder with `SKILL.md`
- Pattern: `action-object` or `domain-action`
- Examples: `analyze-conversations/`, `deploy-application/`
- Name must match folder name in frontmatter

### Commands

- Format: `kebab-case.md`
- Pattern: `action-workflow` or `workflow-type`
- Examples: `code-review-checklist.md`, `setup-project.md`

### Subagents

- Format: `kebab-case.md`
- Pattern: `role` or `action-specialist`
- Examples: `conversation-analyzer.md`, `security-auditor.md`

### General Naming Rules

- Use kebab-case consistently
- Be descriptive but concise (under 30 characters when possible)
- Avoid abbreviations
- Use verbs for actions

## File Organization Patterns

### Flat vs Categorized

- **Flat**: Good for small collections (<10 items)
- **Categorized**: Better for larger collections (>10 items)
- **Hybrid**: Flat root with categories for specific domains

### Organization Principles

1. **Functional Grouping**: Group by what the artifact does
2. **Domain Grouping**: Group by domain (frontend, backend, DevOps)
3. **Workflow Grouping**: Group by workflow stage (setup, development, testing, deployment)
4. **Meta Category**: Separate meta/system artifacts from domain artifacts

### Directory Structure

- Keep related files together
- Use consistent structure across categories
- Document organization in README files
- Maintain clear hierarchy

## When to Create Subdirectories

Create subdirectories when:
- You have 3+ related artifacts
- Artifacts belong to a distinct domain
- Category is likely to grow
- Clear functional boundary exists
