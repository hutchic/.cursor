# Standalone Repository — .cursor Only

This repository is a **standalone project** for Cursor rules, skills, and commands. Nothing more.

## Where Everything Lives

- **Rules, skills, and commands** all live in the **`.cursor/`** directory.
- Cursor IDE reads directly from `.cursor/`. Edit files in `.cursor/`.

## Optional: Use in Other Projects

To use these artifacts in other projects:

- **Symlink** (e.g. `~/.cursor/skills` → this repo's `.cursor/skills`, or equivalent), or
- **Copy the self-improvement bundle** by running `scripts/install-self-improvement.sh` from this repo with the target project path. That script copies the bundle into the target so the target stays self-contained and portable. This is the only exception to "no install scripts."

**No other installation or setup.** No other scripts that copy or "deploy," no Makefile targets that copy or deploy beyond this one documented method for the bundle.

## What to Avoid

- Do not add scripts that "install" or "configure" except the single self-improvement install script above.
- Do not add Makefile targets that copy, sync, or "deploy" rules/skills/commands.
- Do not document or implement additional "methods" or "modes" of installation.
- Keep documentation aligned with: **standalone project, everything in `.cursor/`.**

When in doubt: **standalone project, `.cursor/` only. That's it.**
