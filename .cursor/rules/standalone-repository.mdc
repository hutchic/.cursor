# Standalone Repository — .cursor Only

This repository is a **standalone project** for Cursor rules, skills, and commands. Nothing more.

## Where Everything Lives

- **Rules, skills, and commands** all live in the **`.cursor/`** directory.
- Cursor IDE reads directly from `.cursor/`. Edit files in `.cursor/`.

## Optional: Global Share

To use these skills and commands in other projects, share them **only via a symlink** (e.g. `~/.cursor/skills` → this repo’s `.cursor/skills`, `~/.cursor/commands` → this repo’s `.cursor/commands`, or equivalent). No install scripts.

**No other installation or setup.** No “global install” scripts, no Makefile targets that copy or “deploy” beyond documenting or creating that optional symlink.

## What to Avoid

- Do not add scripts that “install” or “configure” beyond documenting the optional symlink.
- Do not add Makefile targets that copy, sync, or “deploy” rules/skills/commands beyond symlinking.
- Do not document or implement multiple “methods” or “modes” of installation.
- Keep documentation aligned with: **standalone project, everything in `.cursor/`.**

When in doubt: **standalone project, `.cursor/` only. That’s it.**
